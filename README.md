Entry to the 2015 TruMedia MLB Hackathon

## TODO
Gotta redo the IP/app calculation, that whole 1.2 5.1 thing screwing things up still
	1. Convert to .333, .666
	2. Average

## IDEAS
- Get down to 5-6 attributes
- Train cluster
- Plot interesting guys with radar chart
- Profit!

## Attributes
- IP/App
- MPH
- Break? 
- FB%
- Contact%
- K%
- Whiff%
- BB%
- Aggression
	- Heart of the plate vs edges vs wild
